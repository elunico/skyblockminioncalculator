**If you are having trouble using skyblock-minion-calculator, please tell us *at least* the following things:**
* Have you ever used the calculator before (yes/no) ?
* If so when did you last use it (June 2, 3 days ago, this morning, etc) ? 
* What were you doing when it broke (adding minions, refreshing a lot, editing, etc.) ?

Just this will likely be helpful, but if you know how to answer these questions, and feel inclined, they might also help solve the problem. 

 - OS: [e.g. iOS8.1, Windows 10, etc.]
 - Browser [e.g. stock browser, safari, chrome]
 - Version [e.g. 22]

If you checked the Javascript Console, was there any error messages printed out, and if so paste them below:
